## Purpose
* AS AN employee with a busy schedule
It is important to prioritize and to manage you time effectively. Here is a Work Day planner that will help you do so.

## Requirements

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS codes
* Javascript

## Personal description
* I have used different font and background image that can relate to "time"
* I have used the time frame between 6Am to 9Pm. Th app gives you a time frame of 6 Hours on the upcoming task that you need to tackle and to stay focus on.
* added some icon and the Buttons. Some customers might not know if it's a button, so I created some radius pseudo-class that could indicate It.
* Console log most of the save and delete actions.
* This Tool will really help you stay on track.
